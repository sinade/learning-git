Pushing Local Files to the Remote Repository
Once you’ve done some work on the project, you may want to submit those changes to the remote project on GitHub.

1. For example, create a new text file by entering the following into your PowerShell window:

new-item text.txt
2. Confirmation that the new file is created.

Create new text file in Windows PowerShell.
3. Now check the status of your new Git branch and untracked files:

git status
4. Add your new file to the local project:

git add text.txt
5. Run git status again to make sure the text.txt file has been added. Next, commit the changes to the local project:

git commit –m “Sample 1”
6. Finally, push the changes to the remote GitHub repository:

git push
You may need to enter your username and password for GitHub.
